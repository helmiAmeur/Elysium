# Elysium

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the Elysium application for production, run:

```

./mvnw -Pprod clean verify


```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```

java -jar target/*.jar


```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```

./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify


```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```
